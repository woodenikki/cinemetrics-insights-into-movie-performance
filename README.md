# Movie Success Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze a dataset of movies to uncover insights and patterns that can inform decision-making for movie studios and production companies. By leveraging data science techniques, we explored various aspects of movie success, including budget allocation, audience engagement, and genre preferences.


## Data Analysis

The analysis focused on the following key areas:

1. **Budget Allocation**: We analyzed the distribution of movie budgets to understand the investment patterns and identify the typical budget range for successful movies.

2. **Audience Engagement**: We investigated the relationship between audience ratings, number of votes, and movie popularity to determine the impact of audience engagement on a movie's success.

3. **Genre Preferences**: We examined the genres of popular movies to identify the most well-received and profitable genres, providing insights for catering to audience preferences.

## Key Findings

### Budget Allocation
- Since we are aiming for high ratings, we found that the sweet spot for Production Budgets is around $16-17 Million

### Audience Engagement
- Runtime falloff can hurt your reviews!

### Genre and Rating Preferences
- The data showed that genres with broad appeal, such as Adventure, Action, and Comedy, tend to be among the most popular and well-received by audiences. We also found that R-rated movies tend to have the highest review ratings.

## Recommendations

### Investment Strategy
Based on our findings, we recommend that movie studios and production companies allocate a budget of at least $16,000,000 for their projects. This investment level aligns with the typical budget range for successful movies and can increase the chances of creating a high-quality and impactful production.

### Recruit Renowned Writers
Big-name writers and directors on your team can boost ratings significantly. Look into who may be best suited to support your projet.

### Worldwide Access
Domestic Gross only accounts for a portion of how much revenue your film brings in. Promote globally to maximize reach, and allocate resources to making your film accessible to those countries. (Captioning, Audio Dubbing, etc.)
